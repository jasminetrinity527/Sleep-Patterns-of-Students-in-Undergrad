# Sleep-Patterns-of-Students-in-Undergrad
This project is based on analyzing how much sleep students get in undergrad whether they have insomnia or if they are getting the recommended amount of sleep each night. There will be a comparison of each statistic under each column and analyzing which student (s) got the most sleep, and which student (s) didn’t. There will be an analysis using Google Sheets with the use of  Pivot charts, and the basic uses of mean, median mode and range. Along with the datasheet there is a Python code that pulls the “Student Sleep Patterns” data from wherever the .csv file is saved on your PC, and it reads the information and generates a graphical analysis of the sleep patterns. This is a way of analyzing the data automatically for errors that we wouldn’t be able to see with a naked eye. The datasets include the information below of a total of 501 undergrad students at a university. This will point out any correlation of the students' patterns that we may come across during the duration of the project. There are a total of 501 students.
